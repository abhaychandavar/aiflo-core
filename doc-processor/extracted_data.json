Because of their impact on clinical practice, quality criteria for the development of guidelines have been\nestablished in order to make all decisions transparent to the user.\nThe recommendations for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines\n[can be found on the ESC website (https://www.escardio.org/](https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)\n[Guidelines). The ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the](https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)\nESC on a given topic and are regularly updated.\nIn addition to the publication of Clinical Practice guidelines, the ESC\ncarries out the EURObservational Research Programme of international\nregistries of cardiovascular (CV) diseases and interventions which are\nessential to assess diagnostic/therapeutic processes, use of resources\nand adherence to guidelines. These registries aim at providing a better\nunderstanding of medical practice in Europe and around the world,\nbased on high-quality data collected during routine clinical practice.\nFurthermore, the ESC has developed and embedded in this document\na set of quality indicators (QIs), which are tools to evaluate the level of\nimplementation of the guidelines and may be used by the ESC, hospitals,\nhealthcare providers and professionals to measure clinical practice as\nwell as used in educational programmes, alongside the key messages\nfrom the guidelines, to improve quality of care and clinical outcomes.\nThe Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC, including representation from its relevant ESC sub-specialty groups, in\norder to represent professionals involved with the medical care of\npatients with this pathology. Selected experts in the field undertook a\ncomprehensive review of the published evidence for management of\na given condition according to ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines\n(CPG) Committee policy. A critical evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures was performed, including assessment of the\nrisk�benefit ratio. The level of evidence and the strength of the recommendation of particular management options were weighed and\ngraded according to predefined scales, as outlined below.\nThe experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as\nreal or potential sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of\ninterest were reviewed according to the ESC declaration of interest\n[rules and can be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)\n[guidelines) and have been compiled in a report and published in a](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)\nsupplementary document simultaneously to the guidelines.\nThis process ensures transparency and prevents potential biases in\nthe development and review processes. Any changes in declarations of\ninterest that arise during the writing period were notified to the ESC\nand updated. The Task Force received its entire financial support from\nthe ESC without any involvement from the healthcare industry.\nThe ESC CPG supervises and coordinates the preparation of new\nguidelines. The Committee is also responsible for the endorsement\nprocess of these Guidelines. The ESC Guidelines undergo extensive\nreview by the CPG and external experts. After appropriate revisions\nthe guidelines are signed-off by all the experts involved in the Task\nForce. The finalized document is signed-off by the CPG for publication in the European Heart Journal. The guidelines were developed\nafter careful consideration of the scientific and medical knowledge\nand the evidence available at the time of their dating.\nThe task of developing ESC Guidelines also includes the creation of\neducational tools and implementation programmes for the recommendations including condensed pocket guideline versions, summary slides,\nsummary cards for non-specialists and an electronic version for digital\napplications (smartphones, etc.).

    "text": "ESC Guidelines 3609\n\n# 2 Introduction\n\nThe aim of this ESC Guideline is to help health professionals manage\npeople with heart failure (HF) according to the best available evidence. Fortunately, we now have a wealth of clinical trials to help us\nselect the best management to improve the outcomes for people\nwith HF; for many, it is now both preventable and treatable. This\nguideline provides practical, evidence-based recommendations.\nWe have revised the format of the previous 2016 ESC HF\nGuidelines [1] to make each phenotype of HF stand-alone in terms of\nits diagnosis and management. The therapy recommendations mention the treatment effect supported by the class and level of evidence\nand are presented in tables. For HF with reduced ejection fraction\n(HFrEF), the tabular recommendations focus on mortality and morbidity outcomes. Where there are symptomatic benefits, these are\nhighlighted in the text and/or in the web appendices. Detailed summaries of the trials underpinning the recommendations are available\nin the web appendices. For diagnostic indications, we have suggested\ninvestigations that all patients with HF should receive, and investigations that can be targeted to specific circumstances. As diagnostic\ntests have rarely been subject to randomized controlled trials\n(RCTs), most of the evidence would be regarded as level C.\nHowever, that does not mean that there has not been appropriate\nrigorous evaluation of diagnostic tests.\nIn this guideline, we have decided to focus on the diagnosis and\ntreatment of HF, not on its prevention. Management of CV risk and\nmany CV diseases [especially systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction (MI), atrial fibrillation (AF), and asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction]\nwill reduce the risk of developing HF, which is addressed by many\nother ESC Guidelines and in section 9.1 of the current guideline. [2][�][7]\n\nThis guideline is the result of a collaboration between the Task\nForce (including two patient representatives), the reviewers, and the\nESC CPG Committee. As such, it is a consensus/majority opinion of\nthe experts consulted in its development.\n\n2.1 What is new\n\nIn addition to the recommendations listed below, the following table\nlists some new concepts compared with the 2016 version.\n\nNew concepts\n\n|A change of the term ‘heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction’ to<br>‘heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction’ (HFmrEF).|ESC 2021|\n|---|---|\n|A new simplified treatment algorithm for HFrEF.|A new simplified treatment algorithm for HFrEF.|\n|The addition of a treatment algorithm for HFrEF according to<br>phenotypes.|The addition of a treatment algorithm for HFrEF according to<br>phenotypes.|\n|Modified classification for acute HF.|Modified classification for acute HF.|\n|Updated treatments for most non-cardiovascular comorbidities<br>including diabetes, hyperkalaemia, iron deficiency, and cancer.|Updated treatments for most non-cardiovascular comorbidities<br>including diabetes, hyperkalaemia, iron deficiency, and cancer.|\n|Updates on cardiomyopathies including the role of genetic testing and<br>new treatments.|Updates on cardiomyopathies including the role of genetic testing and<br>new treatments.|\n|The addition of key quality indicators.|The addition of key quality indicators.|\n\n\n\nHF = heart failure.\n\n\n.

It is due to a structural and/or functional abnormality of the\nheart that results in elevated intracardiac pressures and/or inadequate cardiac output at rest and/or during exercise.\nIdentification of the aetiology of the underlying cardiac dysfunction\nis mandatory in the diagnosis of HF as the specific pathology can\ndetermine subsequent treatment. Most commonly, HF is due to\nmyocardial dysfunction: either systolic, diastolic, or both. However,\npathology of the valves, pericardium, and endocardium, and abnormalities of heart rhythm and conduction can also cause or contribute\n\nto HF.\n\n. [........................................................]\n\n\n3.2 Terminology\n3.2.1 Heart failure with preserved, mildly reduced, and\nreduced ejection fraction\nTraditionally, HF has been divided into distinct phenotypes based on\nthe measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)\n(Table 3). The rationale behind this relates to the original treatment\ntrials in HF that demonstrated substantially improved outcomes in\npatients with LVEF <_40%. However, HF spans the entire range of\nLVEF (a normally distributed variable), and measurement by echocardiography is subject to substantial variability. We have decided on the\nfollowing classification of HF (Table 3):\n\n - [Reduced LVEF is defined as <_40%, i.e. those with a significant]\n\nreduction in LV systolic function. This is designated as HFrEF.\n\n - [Patients with a LVEF between 41% and 49% have][ mildly][ reduced]\n\nLV systolic function, i.e. HFmrEF. Retrospective analyses from\nRCTs in HFrEF or HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)\nthat have included patients with ejection fractions in the\n40�50% range suggest that they may benefit from similar\n\n",

RV mechanics and function are altered in the setting of either\npressure or volume overload.

The diagnosis and management\nof RV dysfunction is covered comprehensively in a recent Heart\nFailure Association (HFA) position paper.

This\ncan result in a hospital admission or treatment with intravenous (i.v.)\ndiuretic therapy in the outpatient setting. In addition, HF can present\nmore acutely. Both of these are considered in the section on AHF\n(section 11).\nSome individuals with HF may recover completely [e.g. those due\nto alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy (CMP), viral myocarditis,\nTakotsubo syndrome, peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM), or\ntachycardiomyopathy]. Other patients with LV systolic dysfunction\nmay show a substantial or even complete recovery of LV systolic\nfunction after receiving drug and device therapy.\n\n3.2.4 Terminology related to the symptomatic severity of\n\nheart failure\n\nThe simplest terminology used to describe the severity of HF is the\nNew York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification\n(Table 4). However, this relies solely on symptoms and there are\nmany other better prognostic indicators in HF. [19] Importantly,\npatients with mild symptoms may still have a high risk of hospitalization and death. [20] Predicting outcome is particularly important in\nadvanced HF to guide selection of cardiac transplantation and device\ntherapies. This will be covered in detail in the section on advanced\nHF (section 10).\n\n3.3 Epidemiology and natural history of\nheart failure\n\n3.3.1 Incidence and prevalence\nIn developed countries, the age-adjusted incidence of HF may be falling, presumably reflecting better management of CV disease, but due\nto ageing, the overall incidence is increasing. [21][�][24] Currently, the incidence of HF in Europe is about 3/1000 person-years (all age-groups)\nor about 5/1000 person-years in adults. [25][,][26] The prevalence of HF\nappears to be 1�2% of adults. [21][,][27][�][31] As studies only usually include\nrecognized/diagnosed HF cases, the true prevalence is likely to be\nhigher. [32] The prevalence increases with age: from around 1% for\nthose aged <55 years to >10% in those aged 70 years or over. [33][�][36] It\n\n\n\n- [Those with symptoms and signs of HF, with evidence of]\n\nstructural and/or functional cardiac abnormalities and/or raised\n\nnatriuretic peptides (NPs), and with an LVEF >_50%, have HFpEF.\n\n\nThe diagnosis of HFrEF, HFmrEF, and HFpEF is covered in more\ndetail in their respective sections (sections 5, 7, and 8, respectively).\nThese definitions are consistent with a recent report on the\nUniversal Definition of Heart Failure.

RV mechanics and function are altered in the setting of either\npressure or volume overload. [16] Although the main aetiology of\nchronic RV failure is LV dysfunction-induced pulmonary hypertension, there are a number of other causes of RV dysfunction [e.g.\nMI, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), or\nvalve disease]. [17] The diagnosis is determined by a quantitative\nassessment of global RV function, most commonly by echocardiography, using at least one of the following measurements: fractional area change (FAC); tricuspid annular plane systolic\nexcursion (TAPSE); and Doppler tissue imaging-derived systolic S [0]\n\nvelocity of the tricuspid annulus.

[48][�][52]\n\nHFpEF is generally considered to confer a better survival than\n\nHFrEF, but most observational studies show that this difference is\nnegligible. [45][,][46] In contrast, the large MAGGIC meta-analysis concluded that the adjusted mortality risk for patients with HFpEF was\nconsiderably lower than in patients with HFrEF. [53]\n\nStudies from several countries have shown that between 1980 and\n2000 survival in HF patients has improved markedly. [41][,][54][�][57]\n\nHowever, this positive trend may have levelled off since then. [45]\n\nAfter the initial diagnosis, HF patients are hospitalized once every\nyear on average. [54] From 2000 to 2010, the mean rate of hospitalization in the Olmsted County cohort was 1.3 per person-year.\nInterestingly, the majority (63%) of hospitalizations were related to\nnon-CV causes. [45] Studies from several European countries and the\nUnited States (US) have shown that HF hospitalization rates peaked\nin the 1990s, and then declined. [54][,][55] - [,][58][�][60] However, in a recent\n\nstudy of incident HF conducted between 1998 and 2017 in the\nUnited Kingdom (UK), age-adjusted rates of first hospitalizations\nincreased by 28% for both all-cause and HF admissions, and by 42%\nfor non-CV admissions. [61] These increases were higher in women,\nperhaps related to higher comorbidity rates. The risk of HF hospitalization is 1.5 times higher in patients with diabetes compared to controls. AF, a higher body mass index (BMI), and higher glycated\nhaemoglobin (HbA1c), as well as a low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are strong predictors of HF hospitalizations. [29]\n\nDue to population growth, ageing, and the increasing prevalence\nof comorbidities, the absolute number of hospital admissions for HF\nis expected to increase considerably in the future, perhaps by as\nmuch as 50% in the next 25 years. [24][,][62]\n# 4 Chronic heart failure\n\n4.1 Key steps in the diagnosis of chronic\nheart failure\n\nThe diagnosis of CHF requires the presence of symptoms and/or\nsigns of HF and objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction (Figure 1).\nTypical symptoms include breathlessness, fatigue, and ankle swelling\n(Table 6). Symptoms and signs lack sufficient accuracy to be used\nalone to make the diagnosis of HF. [63][�][66]\n\nThe diagnosis of CHF is made more likely in patients with a history\nof MI, arterial hypertension, CAD, diabetes mellitus, alcohol misuse,\nchronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiotoxic chemotherapy, and in\nthose with a family history of CMP or sudden death.\nThe following diagnostic tests are recommended for the assessment of patients with suspected chronic HF:\n\n(1) Electrocardiogram (ECG). A normal ECG makes the diagnosis of\nHF unlikely. [63] The ECG may reveal abnormalities such as AF, Q\n\nwaves, LV hypertrophy (LVH), and a widened QRS complex\n\n(Table 7) that increase the likelihood of a diagnosis of HF and also\n\nmay guide therapy.\n\n\nTable 4 New York Heart Association functional\nclassification based on severity of symptoms and\nphysical activity\n\n|Class I|No limitation of physical activity.

[32][,][35][,][37][,][38] The ESC Long-Term Registry, in the outpatient setting, reports that 60% have HFrEF, 24% have HFmrEF, and 16% have\nHFpEF. [39] Somewhat more than 50% of HF patients are female. [21][,][40][,][41]\n\n3.3.2 Aetiology of heart failure\nThe most common causes (as well as some key investigations)\nof HF are shown in Table 5. The aetiology of HF varies according\nto geography. In Western-type and developed countries,\ncoronary artery disease (CAD) and hypertension are predominant factors. [27]\n\nWith regard to ischaemic aetiology, HFmrEF resembles HFrEF,\nwith a higher frequency of underlying CAD compared to those with\nHFpEF. [38][,][42][,][43]\n\n3.3.3 Natural history and prognosis\nThe prognosis of patients with HF has improved considerably since\nthe publication of the first treatment trials a few decades ago.\nHowever, it remains poor, and quality of life (QOL) is also markedly\nreduced. The improvement in prognosis has been confined to those\n\nwith HFrEF.\n\nMortality rates are higher in observational studies than in clinical\ntrials. [44] In the Olmsted County cohort, 1-year and 5-year mortality\nrates after diagnosis, for all types of HF patients, were 20% and 53%,\nrespectively, between 2000 and 2010. [45] A study combining the\nFramingham Heart Study (FHS) and Cardiovascular Health Study\n(CHS) cohorts reported a 67% mortality rate within 5 years following\ndiagnosis. [46] Despite receiving less evidence-based treatment, women\nhave a better survival than men. [47]\n\nOverall prognosis is better in HFmrEF compared to HFrEF. [39] Of\nnote, transition in ejection fraction over time is common, and patients\nwho progress from HFmrEF to HFrEF have a worse prognosis than\n\n\n.
